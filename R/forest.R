#' Forest Spatial and Diversity Data
#'
#' Overstory, midstory, and understory diversity and richness at 30 sites in Adams, Wells, and Allen Counties, Indiana, with floristic quality index (FQI), percent canopy cover (Canopy), percent volumetric soil moisture content (VMC), estimated forest age (from dendrochronology), basal area (mÂ²/ha), forest area (ha), perimeter (m), shape (perimeter:area ratio), and harvest historical occurrance (binomial). Understory diversity and richness only include woody plant species.
